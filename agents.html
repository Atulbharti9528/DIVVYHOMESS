    <div >
        <h3>Grow your business today</h3>
        <p>We approve people who might <br> 
           not qualify for a traditional <br>
           mortgage. Diversify your leads <br>
           by serving even more clients.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Earn your full commission</h3>
        <p>We purchase the home with an <br>
           all-cash offer and close in as <br>
           few as 14 days. 
           Your client can move  <br>
           in quickly, and you get your full <br>
            commission. It’s a win-win-win.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Give the gift of homeownership</h3>
          <p>  With home savings built into <br>
             the program, it’s even easier for <br>
            your clients to save up for a <br>
             down payment to buy back the <br>
             home within three years or less.</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
       <h3> Close the deals <br> you’d normally lose </h3>
  <p> Instead of losing a deal due to  <br>
      financing falling through, with <br> 
    Divvy you keep your client and <br>
      get the power of Divvy’s all-cash  offer terms to close quickly.

            <p>Once your client is approved for a monthly budget, take them <br>
             home shopping for their future home, or put an offer on a <br>
             home they’ve already had their eye on.</p>

            <h3> <input class="input-box4" type="number" value="3">Close an all-cash offer </h3>
            <p>When your client is ready, Divvy buys the home and you’ll  <br>
             represent us as the buyer in the transaction and earn your full <br>
              commission. Close in as little as two weeks with an all-cash offer <br>
               that doesn’t require jumping through a traditional lender’s hoops.</p>
